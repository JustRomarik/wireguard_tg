# Wireguard Telegram bot 
---
## For what?
This bot is needed to simplify control over your wireguard server.  
It is needed so that if you need to log into the server, you can add a new user and receive a qr code that you can give to your friend or someone else.

## Functions
- Turn on or off wireguard service
- Add new user and get qr code with user config
- Get your current wireguard config in its entirety

## Quick start 
Step 1: Clone this repository 
```
git clone https://github.com/romus204/wireguard_tg.git
```
Step 2: Fill out the config <kbd>config.yml</kbd> file  
Step 3: Run the <kbd>main</kbd> file or make the necessary changes to the code, compile the program and run

***Note***: The configuration file <kbd>config.yml</kbd> must be in the same directory as the executable file.  

***Note***: The bot must have access to server configuration files and the ability to restart the service, so it must be run with privileged rights.
